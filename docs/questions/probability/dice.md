#### ðŸ“– Q2: Suppose we play a game. I roll a die up to three times. Each time I roll, you can either take the number showing as dollars, or roll again. What is your expected winnings?
$$ 
E[\text{ 1 die}] = 3.5 
$$

$$ 
E[\text{ 2 die}] = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.5 + \frac{1}{6} \times (4+5+6) = 4.25
$$ 
when fist roll is $\{1,2,3\} < 3.5$, roll again; 

$$ 
E[\text{ 3 die}] = \frac{4}{6} \times 4.25 + \frac{1}{6} \times (5+6) = 4.67
$$ 
when second roll is $\{1,2,3,4\} < 4.25$, roll again; 

Answer: 4.67
