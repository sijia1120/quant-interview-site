#### ðŸ“– Q1: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> Consider the following game. The player tosses a die once only. The payoff is 1 dollar for each dot on the upturned face. Assuming a fair die, at what level should you set the ticket price of this game? </p>

$$
E[\text{ 1die}] = \frac{1}{6}(1+2+3+4+5+6) = 3.5
$$
Answer: 3.5

#### ðŸ“– Q2 Dice game: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> Suppose that you roll a dice. For each roll, you are paid the face value. If a roll gives 4, 5 or 6, you can roll the dice again. Once you get 1, 2 or 3, the game stops. What is the expected payoff of this game? </p> 




Let $E$ be the expected total payoff. With probability $\frac{1}{2}$, you roll a 1, 2, or 3 and the game ends. The expected payoff in this case is: $\frac{1}{6}(1 + 2 + 3) = 1$. With probability $\frac{1}{2}$, you roll a 4, 5, or 6 and continue the game. The expected value of such a roll is: $\frac{1}{6}(4 + 5 + 6) = 5$. But since you roll again after this, the total expected value becomes: $5 + E$

Putting it all together:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (5 + E) \Rightarrow E = \boxed{7}
$$

#### ðŸ“– Q2: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> Suppose we play a game. I roll a die up to three times. Each time I roll, you can either take the number showing as dollars, or roll again. What is your expected winnings? </p> 
$$ 
E[\text{ 1 die}] = 3.5 
$$

$$ 
E[\text{ 2 die}] = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.5 + \frac{1}{6} \times (4+5+6) = 4.25
$$ 
when fist roll is $\{1,2,3\} < 3.5$, roll again; 

$$ 
E[\text{ 3 die}] = \frac{4}{6} \times 4.25 + \frac{1}{6} \times (5+6) = 4.67
$$ 
when second roll is $\{1,2,3,4\} < 4.25$, roll again; 

Answer: 4.67

#### ðŸ“– **Q3 Dice Order**: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>  We throw 3 dice one by one. What is the probability that we obtain 3 points in strictly increasing order ?</p> 

Each die has 6 faces, and we roll 3 dice independently and the Total outcomes = $6^3 = 216$. To be strictly increasing, the three numbers must be all distinct and ordered such that $a < b < c$. Each of these 3-number sets (e.g., {2, 4, 6}) has $\binom{6}{3}=20$ permutations. And each permutations has $3!$ combination, but only 1 of them is strictly increasing. So $\text{Favorable outcomes} = \binom{6}{3} \times \frac{1}{6^3} =20/216 = 5/54$.
