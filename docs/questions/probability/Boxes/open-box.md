#### ðŸ“– Q1: Let's play a game. There are four sealed boxes. There is 100 pounds in one box and the others are empty. A player can pay X to open a box and take the contents as many times as they like. Assuming this is a fair game, what is the value of X ?
$$
100 = \frac{1}{4} \times X + \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3}  \times (2X) + \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \times (3X) + \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \times (4X)
$$
