#### A chess board consists of 2 inch by 2 inch squares. We toss a coin (diameter of 1 inch) that lands somewhere on the board randomly. What is the probability that the coin is completely within one of the 2 inch by 2 inch squares (not on more than 1 square)?

Answer: $X<0.5$ or $X>3.5$. $Y<0.5$ or $Y>3.5$. This gives a total area that the center can land in of $$\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 1$$ and the total area is 4ï¼Œ This gives us the answer of 1/4.
