#### ðŸ“– Q1: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> A casino offers a simple card game. There are 52 cards in a deck with 4 cards for each value 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, J(jack), Q(queen), K(king), A(ace). Each time the cards are thoroughly shuffled (so each card has equal probability of being selected). You pick up a card from the deck and the dealer picks another one without replacement. If you have a larger number, you win; if the numbers are equal or yours is smaller, the house winsâ€” as in all other casinos, the house always has better odds of winning. What is your probability of winning?  </p> 


Method 1: <br />
If i chose 2, $P(\text{win}) = 1/13 * 0$; <br />
If i chose 3, $P(\text{win}) = 1/13 * (4/51)$; <br />
If i chose 4, $P(\text{win}) = 1/13 * (8/51)$; <br />
$\Rightarrow$ $P(\text{win}) = \frac{1}{13} \times \frac{4}{51} \times (1+2+...+12)$
<br />
Method 2:
$P(\text{I win}) = P(\text{I lose})$; $P(\text{equal}) = 3/51$ $\Rightarrow$ $P(\text{I win})= \frac{1}{2}(1-\frac{3}{51})$

Answer: 8/17

#### ðŸ“– Q2: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> Fifty-two cards are randomly distributed to 4 players with each player getting 13 cards. What is the probability that each of them will have an ace?  </p> 

Method 1: Probability distributing 52 cards into 4 groups is $\frac{52!}{13!13!13!13!}$ permutations. To make sure each have an ace is 4! permutations and distributing rest 48 cards into 4 groups is $\frac{48!}{12!12!12!12!}$. Therefore, probability that each of them will have an ace is $\frac{4! \times \frac{48!}{12!12!12!12!}}{\frac{52!}{13!13!13!13!}} = \frac{4! \times 13 \times 13 \times 13\times 13}{52 \times 51 \times 50 \times 49}$

<p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>  Method 2:  Let's begin with any one of the four aces; it has probability $\frac{52}{52}=1$ of belonging to a pile. The second ace can be any of the remaining 51 cards, among which 39 belong to a pile different from the first ace. So the probability that the second ace is not in the pile of the first ace is $\frac{39}{51}$. Now there are 50 cards left, among which 26 belong to the other two piles. So the conditional probability that the third ace is in one of the other 2 piles given the first two aces are already in different piles is $\frac{26}{50}$. Similarly, the conditional probability that the fourth ace is in the pile different from the first three aces given that the first three aces are in different piles is 13/49. So the probability that each pile has an ace is $\frac{52}{52} \times \frac{39}{51} \times \frac{26}{50} \times \frac{13}{49}$ </p>
