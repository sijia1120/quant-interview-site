#### ðŸ“– Q1: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> You are waiting for a bus at a bus station. The buses arrive at the station according to a Poisson process with an average arrival time of 10 minutes ($\lambda$ = 0.1/min). If the buses have been running for a long time and you arrive at the bus station at a random time, what is your expected waiting time? On average, how many minutes ago did the last bus leave?  </p> 

Waiting time $T$ follows a exponetial distribution where $f_T(t)= \lambda e^{-\lambda t}$
