#### ðŸ“– Q1: Two gamblers are playing a coin toss game. Gambler A has $(n+1)$ fair coins; B has $n$ fair coins. What is the probability that A will have more heads than B if both flip all their coins?

Method1 : when A and B both have n coin, P(A win) = x; P(B win) = x; P(equal) = y; $\Rightarrow$  $2x+y=1$;  

Answer: $P(\text{A win})*1 + P(\text{equal})\times \frac{1}{2} = x + 1/2y= 1/2$
