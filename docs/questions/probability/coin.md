#### ðŸ“– Q1: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> Two gamblers are playing a coin toss game. Gambler A has $(n+1)$ fair coins; B has $n$ fair coins. What is the probability that A will have more heads than B if both flip all their coins? </p> 

Method1 : when A and B both have n coin, P(A win) = x; P(B win) = x; P(equal) = y; $\Rightarrow$  $2x+y=1$;  

Answer: $P(\text{A win})*1 + P(\text{equal})\times \frac{1}{2} = x + 1/2y= 1/2$

#### ðŸ“– Q2 Unfair Coin: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> You are given 1000 coins. Among them, I coin has heads on both sides. The other 999 coins are fair coins. You randomly choose a coin and toss it 10 times. Each time, the coin turns up heads. What is the probability that the coin you choose is the unfair one? </p> 

P(unfair coin|HH) P(HH) = P(HH|unfair coin) P(unfair coin); As P(HH) = P( HH|unfair coin) P(unfair coin) + As P(HH) = P( HH|fair coin) P(fair coin) = $1 \times \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{999}{1000} $. Therefore, the $P(\text{unfair coin}|HH)$ = $\frac{P(HH|\text{unfair coin}) P(\text{unfair coin})}{P(HH)} = \frac{1 \times \frac{1}{1000}}{1 \times \frac{1}{1000} + \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{999}{1000}}$.

#### ðŸ“– Q3 Fair probability from a n unfair coin: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> If you have an unfair coin,  which may bias toward either heads or tails at an unknown probability, can you generate even odds using this coin? </p> 

Assume the $P(head) = p$ and $P(tail) = 1-p$; The probability of first head and second tail is $p *(1-p)$ and the probability of first tail and second head if $(1-p)p$.  By assigning HT to winning and TH to losing, we can generate even odds.

#### ðŸ“– **Q4 Coin toss game**: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Two players, A and B, alternatively toss a fair coin (A tosses the coin first, then B tosses the coin, then A, then B...). The sequence of heads and tails is recorded. If there is a lead followed by a tall (HT subsequence), the game ends and the person who tosses the tail wins. What is the probability that A wins the game? </p>

Let $P(A)$ be the probability that A wins. Letâ€™s condition on A's first toss (since A goes first):

- With probability $\frac{1}{2}$, A tosses a T.
- With probability $\frac{1}{2}$, A tosses a H. 

If A tosses a T. Now it's B's turn. This effectively restarts the game, but with B as the new "first" player. And B(first player) wanna win, A has to lose. So $P(A \mid \text{first toss = T}) = 1 - P(A)$.

If A tosses a H. B tosses next, if B tosses T, A loses. if B tosses H, B becomes the first player and $P(A|H) = \frac{1}{2} \times 0 + \frac{1}{2} \times (1 -P(A|H)) $ $\Rightarrow P(A|H) = 1/3$. 

Combining all the available information, we have 
$$
P(A) = P(A \mid \text{first toss = T}) P(T) + P(A \mid \text{first toss = H}) P(H)
$$

$$
P(A) = (1-P(A)) \times 1/2 + 1/3 \times 1/2 \Rightarrow P(A) = 4/9
$$

Answer: P(A)= 4/9
