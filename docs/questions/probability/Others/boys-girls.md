#### ðŸ“– Q3: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> In a primitive society, every couple prefers to have a baby girl. There is a 50% chance that each child they have is a girl, and the genders of their children are mutually independent. If each couple insists on having more children until they get a girl and once they have a girl they will stop having more children, what will eventually happen to the fraction of girls in this society? </p> 

Answer: having more children until they get a girl follows a `geometric distribution`. For example, if the probability of success in each trial is p = 0.5 (like having a girl), then: $\mathbb{E}[X] = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2$. So, on average, 2 children are needed until a girl is born â€” 1 girl and 1 boy on average.
