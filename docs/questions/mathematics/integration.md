#### ðŸ“– Q2: Integral of $sec(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = \pi / 6$?

The derivative of $\text{sec x + tan x}$ is $\text{sec x(sec x + tan x)}$

Answer: $\text{ln|sec x + tan x|} + c = ln(\sqrt{3})$

#### ðŸ“– Q3: Suppose that two cylinders each with radius 1 intersect at right angles and their centers also intersect. What is the volume of the intersection?

The derivative of $\text{sec x + tan x}$ is $\text{sec x(sec x + tan x)}$

Answer: $\text{ln|sec x + tan x|} + c = ln(\sqrt{3})$

#### ðŸ“– Q5: The snow began to fall some time before noon at a constant rate. The city of Cambridge sent out a snow plow at noon to clear Massachusetts Avenue from MIT to Harvard. The plow removed snow at a constant volume per minute. At 1 pm, it had moved 2 miles and at 2 pm, 3 miles. When did the snow begin to fall?
