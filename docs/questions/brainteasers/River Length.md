#### ðŸ“– Q1: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> You are in a river of unknown length and velocity. You know that if you are stationary on the river, then it takes you 6 seconds for you to reach the other end. If you swim down the river at a rate of 3 feet per second, then it takes you 3 seconds to reach the other end. Find the length of the river (in feet).</p> 

Hint: $$v_{w}6 =l $$ and  $$(v_{w}+3)4 =l  \Rightarrow l =36$$

Answer: 36
