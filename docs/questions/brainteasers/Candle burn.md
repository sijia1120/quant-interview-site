#### ðŸ“– Q1: <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}> We have two candles of the same size and uniform density. One burns in 2 hours, while the other burns in 1 hour. At what time should we simultaneously light these candles in order to have one candle be double the length of the other at 4 PM? Answer in military time. For example if the answer is 8:20 PM, answer </p> 

Hint: Let's assume the x is the consumed volumn per unit time for 1hr-candle and the consumed volumn per unit time for 2hr-candle must be $$\frac{x}{2}$$. Question becomes $$1-\frac{x}{2} = 2(1-x)$$, and x is 2/3 which is 40 mins. 

Answer: 3:20pm.
